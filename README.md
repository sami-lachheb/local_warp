# 🖥️ Terminal AI Assistant

A local CLI tool that transforms your natural language requests into shell commands using the [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API and the **Mistral** model — inspired by Warp AI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Natural Language Understanding** – Convert simple English to bash commands  
- 🗂️ **Context-Aware** – Uses working directory, history, and errors for better command accuracy  
- ✅ **Command Confirmation** – Always asks before executing commands or modifying files  
- 🎨 **Rich Output** – Optional color and formatting using `rich`  
- 🛡️ **Safe Execution** – Catches errors and shows output or failure details  
- 🔐 **Simple API Integration** – Uses OpenRouter’s `mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free` model

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python **3.9+**
- OpenRouter API Key ([Get yours here](https://openrouter.ai/keys))
- Bash-compatible shell

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Local_warp
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your API key**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

4. **(Optional) Make the script executable**
   ```bash
   chmod +x main.py
   ```

---

## 🧪 Usage

```bash
source venv/bin/activate      # Activate your virtual environment
python3 main.py               # Or use ./main.py if executable
```

### 🧑‍💻 Example Prompt

```bash
❯ What do you need help with? list all files in this directory sorted by size
```

```bash
Proposed command:
du -sh * | sort -h

Execute this command? [y/n]: y
```

### 🛑 To exit:
- Type `exit` or `quit`
- Or press `Ctrl+C`

## 💡 Examples of What You Can Ask

- "Show me the disk usage of all folders in the current directory"
- "Find all Python files that contain the word 'openrouter'"
- "Create a new directory called `projects` with a subfolder `python`"
- "Show me the 10 most recently modified files"
- "Check the current CPU and memory usage"
- "Extract all zip files in the current directory"

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit the `.env` file:
```env
# Get your API key from https://openrouter.ai/keys
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Optional tweaks:
- `src/llm/openrouter.py`: Change model, temperature, headers
- `src/terminal/context.py`: Adjust terminal context logic
- `src/terminal/executor.py`: Configure shell behavior and error management

## 🗂️ Project Structure

├── main.py                 # CLI entry point
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── .env                    # API key
└── src/
    ├── terminal/
    │   ├── context.py      # Get working dir, history, errors

```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Captures terminal state (working directory, history, last error)
2. Builds a dynamic prompt based on user input and context
3. Sends the prompt to Mistral via OpenRouter
4. Displays the generated bash command
5. Waits for user confirmation (Enter)
6. Executes and shows results or errors

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Subshell execution: environment changes like `cd` won't persist between runs
- The free tier of Mistral has rate limits
- Multi-step tasks may require breaking down into smaller commands
